* Introduction

I am a Ph.D student in the Faculty of Computing and Electrical Engineering,  [[http://www.tuni.fi/en][Tampere University]]. I am working on computer vision under the supervision of Professor [[http://esa.rahtu.fi/][Esa Rahtu]] from Tampere University and Professor [[https://users.aalto.fi/~kannalj1/][Juho Kannala]] from [[http://www.aalto.fi/en/][Aalto University]].
          Prior to coming to Finland, I was working as a Researcher at [[https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation][Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Innovation and Research]] where I was working on sensor signal processing. I obtained my Master's degree from [[https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/][Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar]] in Electronics and Communication Engineering. I did my thesis with Professor  [[https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=ooCsX-UAAAAJ&hl=en][Ganapati Panda]] on compressive sensing.
