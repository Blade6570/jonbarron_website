#+TITLE: GTags for Python in Emacs

* Prologue

  I usually code in Python and when I have a lot of functions in different files in a project then it is desirable to jump to the function definition from its identifier at point. In Emacs, Elpy has ~(elpy-goto-definition)~ with keybinding ~Meta-.~, that sometimes works on local files and doesn't most of the time on remote files. There are some other good options like ~elpy-rgrep-symbol~, ~rgrep~ but they are not that efficient. I have also tried ~lsp-mode~ with /mspyls/ which works good in local but always complains about ~server-time-elapsed~ over tramp. As I work mostly on my servers, it is really important for me to get a reliable tool for this feature.

  I came across  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/global/][gnu-global]] on some online platform which is widely used by C-programmers for similar use-cases as of mine. The main idea is to create TAG files of your source codes and feed them to Emacs for navigation around the project. This tool works for python too but with some extra plugins that I have discussed below. I followed the [[https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/+tags/gtags/README.html][gtags-spacemacs]] guide which works for my vanilla-Emacs too. To make it work over tramp I had to install gnu-global on the server and this article summerizes those steps.

* Install gnu-global on server

  If you have the admin rights on the server then you can follow the same instruction as of [[https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/+tags/gtags/README.html][gtags-spacemacs]] and everything works fine. Without the ~sudo~ rights, you need to do the following steps to install it properly. Before installing gnu-global, first I had to install all the dependencies like,

     *ctags*:
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       - git clone https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags.git
       - cd ctags
       - bash autogen.sh
       - ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install (keep the path-to-install same for all the rest of the packages)
       - make
       - make install
       - cd ..
       #+END_SRC


    *gperf*:
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       - wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gperf/gperf-3.1.tar.gz
       - tar -xf gperf-3.1.tar.gz
       - cd gperf-3.1
       - ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install (keep it same as of ctags)
       - make
       - make install
       - cd ..
       #+END_SRC


    *libtool*:
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       - wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz (this version is important)
       - tar -xf libtool-2.4.2.tar.gz
       - cd libtool-2.4.2
       - ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install (keep it same as of ctags)
       - make
       - make install
       - cd ..
       #+END_SRC

    *texinfo*:
       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       - wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-6.7.tar.xz
       - tar -xf texinfo-6.7.tar.xz
       - cd texinfo-6.7
       - ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install (keep it same as of ctags)
       - make
       - make install
       - cd ..
       #+END_SRC

I added the installation path (~path/to/install/bin~) to the ~.bashrc~ to access them from the terminal directly.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export PATH="/path/to/install/bin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC

Finally, install the ~gnu-global~ with the following three commands.

       #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       - wget https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/global/global-6.6.tar.gz
       - tar -xf global-6.6.tar.gz
       - cd global-6.6
       - ./configure --with-exuberant-ctags=/path/to/install/bin/ctags --prefix=/path/to/install/  (keep it same as ctags)
       - make
       - make install
       - cp gtags.conf ~/.globalrc (copy the config to the globalrc)
       - echo export GTAGSLABEL=pygments >> .profile
       - cd ..
       #+END_SRC

* Creating tags and accessing them from Emacs

 - Once gnu-global is installed, I can go to any project directory and type ~gtags --gtagslabel=pygments~ to create gtags. In order to access them from the Emacs, I installed [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-gtags.git][helm-gtags]].

 - Before using ~helm-gtags~ over tramp, I need to tell the tramp the path of gnu-global on the server. I have done that by adding ~(add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/path/to/install/bin")~  to my ~init.el~. If you have multiple severs, then install gnu-global in each of them and add the path to the ~tramp-remote-path~ as mention earlier. Now you are ready to go. The screenshot shows it in action. We can go to any function identifier and then it can take us to the function definition even defined in another file.

** Using helm-gtags in multiple server simulataneously

   - When you have multiple servers open, helm-gtags can use ~gnu-global~ in one of the server and will complain about the ~gnu-global~ path for all others. It is because the ~tramp-remote-path~ needs to be forced updated when you switch the server. It can be done by calling ~tramp-cleanup-all-connections~ from ~M-x~ and then using ~helm-gtags~
   - Another elegant solution is to switch the ~tramp-remote-path~ automatically when we switch to the buffer of another server. I have given an example for two servers with the names ~puhti~ and ~narvi~ and can be extended for more than two.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-path-puhti
   '((tramp-remote-path . ("/projappl/project_2000936/miniconda3/bin"  "/projappl/project_2001838/bin" tramp-default-remote-path)))) ;"/projappl/project_2001838/bin": gnu_global is installed here

(connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-path-narvi
   '((tramp-remote-path . ("/home/tripathy/miniconda3/bin" "/home/tripathy/applications/bin" tramp-default-remote-path)))) ; "/home/tripathy/applications/bin": gnu_global installed here
;"/home/tripathy/miniconda3/bin":  anaconda path for other packages
(connection-local-set-profiles
   '(:application tramp :machine "puhti") 'remote-path-puhti)
(connection-local-set-profiles
   '(:application tramp :machine "narvi") 'remote-path-narvi)
